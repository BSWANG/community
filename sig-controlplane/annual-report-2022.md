## Project health

1. What areas and/or subprojects does your group need the most help with? Any areas with 2 or fewer OWNERs? (link to more details)

- [openyurt](https://github.com/openyurtio/openyurt/blob/master/OWNERS)
- [yurt-app-manager](https://github.com/openyurtio/yurt-app-manager/blob/master/OWNERS)
    - A good community was assembled, and now we have folks giving some support in Slack and issues.
    - weekly meetings for issue and PRs prioritization, with a regular attendance of 10+ participants.
    - The development cadence is normal. It usually takes about three months to release a big version.
    - yurt-app-manage is a subproject in OpenYurt community, there are not a lot of new features and version upgrade.

2. What metrics/community health stats does your group care about and/or measure?

Not currently monitoring metrics or health statistics.

3. Does your [CONTRIBUTING.md] help **new** contributors engage with your group specifically by pointing to activities or programs that provide useful context or allow easy participation?

We do not have a SIG specific CONTRIBUTING.md

4. If your group has special training, requirements for reviewers/approvers, or processes beyond the general [contributor guide], does your [CONTRIBUTING.md] document those to help **existing** contributors grow throughout the [contributor ladder]?

There are no special requirements.

5. Does the group have contributors from multiple companies/affiliations?

Yes - we have long-term as well as one-time contributors from a variety of companies.
